# Treecodes

Treecodes are an aesthetically pleasing alternative to QR codes. Treecodes can encode arbitrary information inside an image which can be decoded at a later time.

QR codes represent information by drawing zeroes and ones as black and white squares. With Treecodes, however, the information is represented as a unique topology of the tree. It does not matter how the tree is drawn: the information contained inside will be the same.
